		          <h4><i class="icon-off"></i>What?</h4>
		          <p></i><strong>Immaterial Labour Isn't Working</strong> is a series of events considering work in the internet age, the place of art within this and the possibilities open and closed by this situation.</p>

		          <h4><i class="icon-group"></i>Work</h4>
		          <p>What does it mean to work now? How have the boundaries between work and play, leisure and activity, social life and work blurred in the modern world? How has this occured while employment itself is made ever more precarious?</p>

		          <h4><i class="icon-picture"></i>Art</h4>
		          <p>What is the status of art in the digital economy? Is the category of art even meaningful in the Tumblr age? What does it mean to be an art worker now, when everyone is a critic and the category is so widely dispersed?</p>

		        <div class="span6">
		          <h4><i class="icon-plus-sign-alt"></i>Health</h4>
		          <p>How is working and socialising on the internet effecting our bodies, our mental health and our ability to inteact with our peers? How is the internet shaping our thoughts, our emotions? With no simple answers in sight.</p>

		          <h4><i class="icon-thumbs-up"></i>Politics</h4>
		          <p>What do the politics of this new condition of work look like? What structures are appropriate to organise in contemporary workplaces? <strong>Immaterial Labour Isn't Working</strong> brings together activists, artists and thinkers to actively consider this question.</p>

		          <h4><i class="icon-heart-empty"></i>Trust</h4>
		          <p><strong>Immaterial Labour Isn't Working</strong> is from the same people as last year's <strong>We Have Our Own Concept Of Time And Motion</strong> - linked to the Arts Council Sponsored <strong>Auto Italia South East</strong>. A purpose build event from brands you can trust.</p>
